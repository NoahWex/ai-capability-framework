## 🧠 Core Frameworks

### Adaptive Analysis Framework

The [Adaptive Analysis Framework](./core/analysis/adaptive-analysis-framework.md) provides a structured approach to problem-solving that:

- Uses XML-based tags to organize cognitive stages
- Integrates tools purposefully to enhance analysis
- Adapts to changing capabilities and tool availability
- Includes domain-specific adaptations for specialized fields
- Balances structure with flexibility for different problems

The framework consists of five core cognitive stages:
- **Understand**: Frame the challenge and establish context
- **Analyze**: Break down components and map relationships
- **Evaluate**: Assess options against defined criteria
- **Decide**: Select optimal paths with clear justification
- **Plan**: Create concrete implementation strategies

### Knowledge Modeling

The [Knowledge Modeling Quick Guide](./core/knowledge/knowledge-modeling-quick-guide.md) provides practical patterns for:

- Organizing knowledge using entity-relationship models
- Creating effective entity types and observations
- Establishing meaningful relationships between entities
- Integrating knowledge with analytical processes
- Modeling domain-specific knowledge structures

### Style Guide Integration System

The [Style Guide Integration System](./core/integration/style-guide-integration-system.md) coordinates multiple style guides with:

- A distributed protocol approach for framework coordination
- Clear patterns for transitioning between different style guides
- Guidelines for selecting the appropriate style for different problems
- Context preservation mechanisms when switching styles
- Hybrid approaches that combine elements from multiple style guides

### Implementation Examples

The [Implementation Examples Collection](./examples/README.md) demonstrates practical applications of the frameworks:

- Problem-solving examples using the Adaptive Analysis Framework
- Knowledge representation examples using the Knowledge Modeling Guide
- Multi-framework approaches using the Style Guide Integration System
- Domain-specific applications in bioinformatics, software engineering, and research
