# Style Guide Transition Examples

*Created: 2025-03-04*  
*Version: 1.0*

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to transition between different style guides in the AI Capability Framework. Each example shows how to maintain context and preserve insights when moving between frameworks.

## Available Examples

### 1. [Analysis to Implementation](analysis-to-implementation.md)
Demonstrates transitioning from the Adaptive Analysis Framework to the TRACE Framework when moving from problem analysis to solution implementation.

### 2. [Knowledge to Implementation](knowledge-to-implementation.md)
Shows how to transition from the Knowledge Modeling Guide to the TRACE Framework when implementing a system based on knowledge models.

### 3. [Hybrid Approach](hybrid-approach.md)
Illustrates how to combine multiple style guides in a single solution, demonstrating the Style Guide Integration System in practice.

## Using These Examples

These examples serve as templates that you can adapt for your own projects. Each example includes:

1. The initial problem statement
2. Application of the first style guide
3. Transition points with explicit context preservation
4. Application of the second style guide
5. Commentary explaining the transition decisions

## Key Transition Patterns

These examples demonstrate key transition patterns from the Style Guide Integration System:

1. **Context Preservation** - How to maintain important insights when switching styles
2. **Explicit Signaling** - Clear indication of style guide transitions
3. **Progressive Refinement** - How each style guide builds on previous work
4. **Hybrid Integration** - Combining elements from multiple style guides

## Contributing New Examples

To contribute a new transition example:

1. Create a new markdown file following the existing pattern
2. Include a real-world problem that benefits from multiple style guides
3. Demonstrate clear transition points with context preservation
4. Add your example to this README
5. Submit a pull request for review
