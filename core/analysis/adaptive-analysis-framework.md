*Version: 1.0*

## 1. Core Framework Overview

The Adaptive Analysis Framework provides structure for thorough, transparent reasoning while remaining flexible for different domains and tool capabilities. It combines:

- **Tag-based structure**: Clear cognitive stages with XML tags
- **Tool integration**: Purpose-driven use of available capabilities
- **Adaptability**: Scaling to different contexts and available tools
- **Evolution awareness**: Accommodating changing capabilities over time

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity before complexity**: Start with clear thinking, add tools only when they enhance understanding
2. **Purpose-driven structure**: Each component serves specific cognitive purposes
3. **Graceful adaptation**: Framework functions effectively regardless of tool availability
4. **Narrative coherence**: Maintain clear thought flow even when using multiple tools
5. **Progressive complexity**: Add sophistication only as needed for the problem
6. **Token efficiency**: Express ideas concisely without sacrificing comprehension

## 2. Tag Structure and Purpose

### 2.1 Core Tags

#### `<understand>` - Frame the challenge and context

**Purpose**: Establish clear understanding of the problem, context, and objectives.

**Required Elements**:
- Core problem statement
- Key contextual factors
- Primary objectives or goals

**Attributes**:
- `depth="overview|detailed"` - Level of understanding depth
- `focus="problem|context|goals"` - Primary focus area

**Example**:
```
<understand depth="detailed" focus="problem">
The core challenge is optimizing database query performance in the user authentication 
service, which currently experiences latency spikes during peak hours, affecting overall 
system responsiveness. This is particularly critical for the upcoming product launch.
</understand>
```

#### `<analyze>` - Break down components and relationships

**Purpose**: Systematically deconstruct the problem into constituent parts and map relationships.

**Required Elements**:
- Component identification
- Relationship mapping
- Pattern recognition

**Attributes**:
- `depth="surface|comprehensive"` - Analysis depth
- `approach="component|system|comparative"` - Analysis methodology

**Example**:
```
<analyze approach="component" depth="comprehensive">
The authentication service performance can be broken down into:

1. Database query patterns - Current implementation uses multiple sequential queries
2. Connection management - New connections established for each request
3. Caching strategy - Limited in-memory caching with no distributed cache
4. Query optimization - Missing indexes on frequently filtered fields
5. Transaction handling - Unnecessarily large transaction scopes
</analyze>
```

#### `<evaluate>` - Assess against criteria and alternatives

**Purpose**: Critically examine options against defined criteria to determine relative merit.

**Required Elements**:
- Evaluation criteria
- Alternative comparison
- Evidence-based assessment

**Attributes**:
- `criteria="specified evaluation framework"` - Criteria being used
- `perspective="critical|balanced|supportive"` - Evaluation perspective

**Example**:
```
<evaluate criteria="impact vs. effort" perspective="balanced">
Evaluating the potential optimizations:

- Connection pooling: High impact, low effort - Would immediately reduce connection overhead
- Query optimization: High impact, medium effort - Requires index analysis and creation
- Caching implementation: High impact, medium-high effort - Needs cache invalidation strategy
- Transaction scoping: Medium impact, low effort - Quick wins with minimal risk
</evaluate>
```

#### `<decide>` - Select optimal path with justification

**Purpose**: Make a clear decision based on evaluation, with transparent reasoning.

**Required Elements**:
- Clear decision statement
- Supporting rationale
- Addressing limitations

**Attributes**:
- `confidence="low|moderate|high"` - Confidence level
- `approach="elimination|weighted|intuitive"` - Decision methodology

**Example**:
```
<decide confidence="high" approach="weighted">
The optimal approach is to implement connection pooling first, followed by transaction 
scoping refinements. This sequence:

1. Addresses the highest impact/lowest effort items immediately
2. Delivers measurable improvements before the product launch
3. Creates a foundation for the more complex query optimization work
4. Minimizes risk while maximizing performance gains

While caching would ultimately provide significant benefits, it requires more design 
work and should be tackled after these initial optimizations.
</decide>
```

#### `<plan>` - Outline implementation strategy

**Purpose**: Create concrete action plan for implementing the decision.

**Required Elements**:
- Action sequence
- Resource requirements
- Timeline considerations

**Attributes**:
- `timeframe="immediate|short-term|long-term"` - Implementation timeline
- `detail="high-level|detailed"` - Plan detail level

**Example**:
```
<plan timeframe="short-term" detail="detailed">
Implementation plan:

1. Connection Pooling (Days 1-2)
   - Implement HikariCP connection pool
   - Configure optimal pool size based on peak load analysis
   - Add monitoring metrics for connection usage

2. Transaction Optimization (Days 3-4)
   - Refactor service methods to use more granular transaction boundaries
   - Remove unnecessary read operations from write transactions
   - Implement read-only transaction hints for queries

3. Testing & Deployment (Day 5)
   - Run performance benchmarks comparing before/after metrics
   - Stage deployment during low-traffic window
   - Implement rollback plan if issues arise
</plan>
```

### 2.2 Optional Auxiliary Tags

#### `<explore>` - Open-ended investigation

**Purpose**: Conduct preliminary exploration when problem space is unclear.

**Example**:
```
<explore scope="broad">
Initial exploration of the performance issue reveals several potential areas:
- Database interaction patterns appear inefficient
- Memory usage grows unexpectedly during peak loads
- Network latency spikes correlate with performance degradation

Further investigation is needed to determine the primary factors.
</explore>
```

#### `<reference>` - Link to external information

**Purpose**: Connect analysis to existing knowledge or resources.

**Example**:
```
<reference type="document" id="perf-analysis-2025-01">
This optimization approach aligns with the database best practices outlined in 
our January 2025 performance analysis, particularly regarding connection handling
and transaction scoping.
</reference>
```

## 3. Tool Integration Patterns

### 3.1 General Integration Principles

1. **Purpose-driven usage**: Each tool should enhance the cognitive purpose of its containing tag
2. **Seamless blending**: Tool outputs should integrate naturally into the analysis flow
3. **Selective application**: Use tools only when they meaningfully enhance understanding
4. **Transparent transitions**: Make clear connections between tool outputs and your analysis
5. **Context preservation**: Maintain narrative coherence when incorporating tool findings

### 3.2 Tag-Specific Tool Patterns

#### `<understand>` Tools Integration

**Effective Patterns**:
- Use knowledge retrieval to establish baseline context
- Apply targeted search for filling specific knowledge gaps
- Employ entity recognition to identify key components

```
<understand depth="detailed" focus="context">
<!-- Establish baseline context with knowledge graph -->
[knowledge_graph.read_graph() to retrieve project context]

This authentication service is part of our core platform infrastructure, handling
approximately 30,000 requests per minute during peak hours. It interfaces with
our PostgreSQL database cluster and serves all client-facing applications.

<!-- Fill specific knowledge gaps -->
[brave_web_search() for recent PostgreSQL connection pooling benchmarks]

Recent benchmarks suggest connection pooling can reduce overhead by 30-40% in
similar high-throughput authentication scenarios.
</understand>
```

#### `<analyze>` Tools Integration

**Effective Patterns**:
- Use sequential thinking for step-by-step problem decomposition
- Apply code search/examination for implementation analysis
- Employ knowledge graph for relationship mapping

```
<analyze approach="component" depth="comprehensive">
<!-- Examine existing implementation -->
[github.get_file_contents() to review database interaction code]

The current implementation reveals several optimization opportunities:

1. Database connections - Each request creates a new connection instead of using pooling
2. Query patterns - Using multiple queries where a join would be more efficient
3. Prepared statements - Not leveraging prepared statements for repeated queries

<!-- Map system relationships -->
[knowledge_graph.create_entities() and create_relations() to map system components]

This diagram shows how the authentication service interacts with five downstream
systems, each with distinct performance characteristics and requirements.
</analyze>
```

#### `<evaluate>` Tools Integration

**Effective Patterns**:
- Use comparative search for evidence-based evaluation
- Apply sequential thinking for methodical assessment
- Leverage knowledge structures for organizing evaluation criteria

```
<evaluate criteria="performance impact" perspective="balanced">
<!-- Research similar optimizations -->
[brave_web_search() for database optimization case studies]
[github.search_code() for connection pooling implementations]

Based on both published case studies and common implementation patterns:

- Connection pooling consistently shows 20-40% throughput improvements
- Prepared statements typically reduce query execution time by 25-30%
- Query optimization through proper indexing yields variable but significant gains
  
<!-- Methodical assessment of options -->
[sequential_thinking() to evaluate tradeoffs between approaches]

After systematically analyzing each option, connection pooling emerges as the
clear priority due to its consistent performance impact and relatively
straightforward implementation.
</evaluate>
```

#### `<decide>` Tools Integration

**Effective Patterns**:
- Use sequential reasoning for complex decisions
- Apply knowledge verification against established facts
- Leverage search for validating approaches

```
<decide confidence="high" approach="weighted">
<!-- Validate decision through reasoning -->
[sequential_thinking() to validate decision pathway]

After careful consideration of all factors, I recommend implementing:

1. Connection pooling as immediate priority
2. Prepared statement optimization as secondary focus
3. Query restructuring as follow-up phase

This sequence maximizes performance gains while minimizing implementation risk.
The decision is supported by both industry best practices and our specific
system architecture constraints.
</decide>
```

#### `<plan>` Tools Integration

**Effective Patterns**:
- Use implementation research for practical planning
- Apply code generation for starter implementations
- Leverage project management patterns for organization

```
<plan timeframe="short-term" detail="detailed">
<!-- Research implementation examples -->
[github.search_repositories() for connection pooling examples]
[github.get_file_contents() to examine specific implementations]

Implementation plan:

1. Connection Pool Configuration (Days 1-2)
   ```java
   // Example HikariCP configuration
   HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
   config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/auth_db");
   config.setUsername("auth_user");
   config.setPassword("auth_password");
   config.setMaximumPoolSize(20); // Based on load analysis
   config.setMinimumIdle(5);
   config.setIdleTimeout(30000);
   ```

2. Service Layer Integration (Days 3-4)
   - Refactor AuthenticationService to use the connection pool
   - Update transaction management to properly return connections
   - Add metrics collection for connection usage

3. Testing & Deployment (Day 5)
   - Implement benchmark suite to compare performance
   - Configure monitoring dashboards for connection metrics
   - Deploy with canary approach to verify stability
</plan>
```

### 3.3 Capability Adaptation

The framework should adapt gracefully to different tool availability levels:

#### Basic Tier (Limited or No Tools)

```
<analyze approach="component">
Without external tools, I'll structure this analysis by systematically breaking down
the problem components:

1. First examining the database interaction patterns
2. Then analyzing connection management approaches
3. Finally evaluating query structure and optimization opportunities

This authentication service appears to have several inefficient patterns in its
database interaction code, particularly in how it manages connections and structures queries.
</analyze>
```

#### Standard Tier (Core Tools)

```
<analyze approach="component">
<!-- Use thinking tools -->
[sequential_thinking() to break down the problem]

The performance bottleneck can be traced to several key components:

1. Connection management - New connections for each request create overhead
2. Query efficiency - Multiple queries where joins would be more efficient
3. Transaction scoping - Overly broad transaction boundaries
</analyze>
```

#### Enhanced Tier (Specialized Tools)

```
<analyze approach="component">
<!-- Leverage domain-specific tools when available -->
[database_analyzer() to examine query performance]
[github.search_code() to find optimization patterns]

The database performance analysis reveals:

1. Connection overhead consuming 45% of request time
2. Query execution plans showing missing indexes
3. Specific hotspot queries with N+1 query patterns

These findings point to connection pooling as the highest-impact optimization.
</analyze>
```

## 4. Domain Adaptations

### 4.1 Domain-Specific Terminology

The framework should adapt to domain-specific terminology and concerns:

#### Software Engineering Adaptation

```
<analyze approach="component">

</analyze>
```

#### Bioinformatics Adaptation

```

The gene expression pipeline shows these optimization opportunities:

1. Parallel processing for ambient RNA filtering
2. Memory-efficient data structures for single-cell matrices
3. GPU acceleration for dimensionality reduction
4. Adaptive clustering parameters based on tissue-specific markers
</analyze>
```

### 4.2 Domain-Specific Evaluation Criteria

```
<evaluate criteria="bioinformatics-specific">
For single-cell RNA analysis, we must evaluate options against:

1. Statistical validity - Ensuring results reflect biological signal
2. Batch effect handling - Minimizing technical variation
3. Computational efficiency - Processing large matrices effectively
4. Biological interpretability - Yielding results that advance understanding
</evaluate>
```

## 5. Implementation Examples

### 5.1 Software Optimization Example

The authentication service shows increasing latency (avg 450ms, up from 200ms) 
during peak hours, affecting user login experience. The service handles 
approximately 30,000 requests per minute and interfaces with PostgreSQL.
</understand>

<analyze approach="component" depth="comprehensive">
<!-- Examine implementation -->
[github.get_file_contents() to review authentication code]

Performance bottlenecks identified:
1. Database connections created per request instead of pooled
2. Multiple sequential queries where joins would be more efficient
3. Missing indexes on frequently filtered columns
4. No statement caching or prepared statements
5. Lack of result caching for repeated queries
</analyze>

<evaluate criteria="impact vs. effort" perspective="balanced">
<!-- Research optimization approaches -->
[brave_web_search() for authentication service optimization]
[github.search_code() for connection pooling implementations]

Evaluating optimization options:
- Connection pooling: High impact (40% improvement), low effort (2 days)

- Query optimization: Medium impact (20-30%), medium effort (3-4 days)
- Result caching: High impact (60-80% for cached queries), medium effort (3-4 days)
</evaluate>

<decide confidence="high" approach="weighted">
Based on impact-to-effort ratio and system criticality, the optimal approach is:

1. Implement connection pooling immediately
2. Add missing indexes in parallel
3. Implement basic result caching for frequently accessed data
4. Defer query restructuring to a follow-up phase

This approach prioritizes quick wins while building foundation for further optimization.

### 5.2 Bioinformatics Pipeline Example

```
<understand depth="detailed" focus="problem">
The scRNA-seq pipeline exhibits excessive memory usage and processing time when
handling ambient RNA filtering for large datasets (>10k cells). Current processing
time is approximately 4.5 hours per sample with peaks of 64GB RAM usage.
</understand>

<analyze approach="component" depth="comprehensive">
<!-- Examine computational bottlenecks -->
[knowledge_graph.read_graph() to understand pipeline architecture]
[github.get_file_contents() to review processing code]

The pipeline analysis reveals:
1. Inefficient matrix operations loading entire expression matrices into memory
2. Sequential processing of samples that could be parallelized
3. Ambient RNA profile calculation repeated for similar cell populations
4. Redundant distance calculations in PCA space
5. Sub-optimal use of sparse matrix operations
</analyze>

<evaluate criteria="computational efficiency" perspective="balanced">
<!-- Research optimization approaches -->
[github.search_code() for sparse matrix operations in bioinformatics]

## 6. Style Guide Evolution

This style guide is designed to evolve through:

1. **Iterative improvement**: Regular refinement based on practical application
2. **Capability adaptation**: Updates as tool capabilities change
3. **Domain extension**: Adding specialized patterns for specific fields
4. **Collaborative enhancement**: Incorporating feedback from framework users

### Framework for Style Guide Updates

1. **Identify improvement opportunities** - Recognize patterns that could be enhanced
2. **Discuss potential changes** - Evaluate options collaboratively
3. **Draft updated guidelines** - Create concise, practical updates
4. **Test in real applications** - Apply changes to actual problems
5. **Formalize in updated guide** - Document successful patterns

The framework should remain practical, focused on real problem-solving rather than theoretical completeness, and should evolve to incorporate changing capabilities and needs.
