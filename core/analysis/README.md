# Analysis Framework

This directory contains guides and patterns for structured analytical thinking, including frameworks for breaking down problems, evaluating options, and making decisions.

## Core Analysis Structure

The analysis framework is built around a sequence of connected stages:

1. **Understand**: Frame the challenge and context
2. **Analyze**: Break down components and relationships
3. **Evaluate**: Assess against criteria and alternatives
4. **Decide**: Select optimal path with justification
5. **Plan**: Outline implementation strategy

Each stage has specific patterns and techniques that maximize effectiveness.
