# Temporal Tracking System

This directory contains the specifications and implementations for tracking knowledge evolution over time.

## System Components

The temporal tracking system includes:

- Standardized timestamp formats across all framework components
- Version control for knowledge entities and observations
- Temporal metadata for tracking creation and modification times
- Decay/reinforcement mechanisms based on usage patterns
- History preservation policies

Implementing these components enables a dynamic understanding of how knowledge evolves.
