## Overview

The integration of Sequential Thinking with Knowledge Graph capabilities creates a powerful synergy that enhances both structured reasoning and persistent knowledge management. This guide provides patterns and techniques for effectively combining these capabilities.

## Key Benefits of Integration

1. **Contextually Informed Reasoning**: Sequential thinking steps can access and incorporate relevant knowledge
2. **Persistent Reasoning Trails**: Key insights from thinking can be preserved in structured knowledge
3. **Evolution of Understanding**: Changes in reasoning can be tracked and linked to knowledge evolution
4. **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Reasoning can be grounded in accumulated knowledge
5. **Reusable Reasoning Patterns**: Common thinking pathways can be identified and reused

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Knowledge-Informed Reasoning

This pattern uses the knowledge graph to provide context and information for sequential thinking.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Initial Context Retrieval**:
   ```javascript
   // Retrieve relevant knowledge before beginning thinking
   function initializeContextualThinking(topic) {
     // Search knowledge graph for relevant context
     const relevantNodes = searchNodes(topic);
     
     // Extract key observations from nodes
     const contextualObservations = relevantNodes.flatMap(
       node => node.observations.map(obs => `[${node.name}] ${obs}`)
     );
     
     // Begin sequential thinking with context
     return sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Initial analysis of ${topic} based on existing knowledge:\n\n${contextualObservations.join('\n')}`,
       thoughtNumber: 1,
       totalThoughts: 5,
       nextThoughtNeeded: true
     });
   }
   ```

2. **In-Process Knowledge Retrieval**:
   ```javascript
   // Retrieve additional knowledge during thinking process
   function enrichThinkingWithKnowledge(currentThought, thoughtNumber, totalThoughts) {
     // Extract key concepts from current thought
     const concepts = extractConcepts(currentThought);
     
     // Search for relevant knowledge about these concepts
     const relevantKnowledge = concepts.flatMap(concept => {
       const nodes = searchNodes(concept);
       return nodes.flatMap(node => node.observations);
     });
     
     // Continue thinking with enriched knowledge
     return sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Continuing analysis with additional knowledge:\n\n${relevantKnowledge.join('\n')}\n\nBased on this information, I can now reason that...`,
       thoughtNumber: thoughtNumber + 1,
       totalThoughts,
       nextThoughtNeeded: thoughtNumber + 1 < totalThoughts
     });
   }
   ```

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Example workflow
async function analyzeProblemWithKnowledgeSupport(problem) {
  // Initialize thinking with knowledge context
  const initialThinking = await initializeContextualThinking(problem);
  
  // Continue thinking with enriched knowledge
  let currentThinking = initialThinking;
  while (currentThinking.nextThoughtNeeded) {
    currentThinking = await enrichThinkingWithKnowledge(
      currentThinking.thought,
      currentThinking.thoughtNumber,
      currentThinking.totalThoughts
    );
  }
  
  // Return final analysis
  return currentThinking.thought;
}
```

### 2. Knowledge Capture from Reasoning

This pattern preserves valuable insights from sequential thinking in the knowledge graph.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Entity Extraction from Thinking**:
   ```javascript
   // Extract key entities from thinking process
   function extractEntitiesFromThinking(thoughtSequence) {
     const entities = [];
     
     // Process each thought for entity extraction
     for (const thought of thoughtSequence) {
       // Extract key concepts as potential entities
       const concepts = extractConcepts(thought.thought);
       
       // Create entity objects
       const newEntities = concepts.map(concept => ({
         name: concept,
         entityType: "Concept",
         observations: [`Identified in thinking: ${thought.thought.substring(0, 100)}...`]
       }));
       
       entities.push(...newEntities);
     }
     
     return entities;
   }
   ```

2. **Relationship Extraction from Thinking**:
   ```javascript
   // Extract relationships between entities from thinking
   function extractRelationsFromThinking(thoughtSequence) {
     const relations = [];
     
     // Process thoughts for relation extraction
     for (const thought of thoughtSequence) {
       // Extract relationship patterns (subject-verb-object)
       const relationPatterns = extractRelationPatterns(thought.thought);
       
       // Create relation objects
       const newRelations = relationPatterns.map(pattern => ({
         from: pattern.subject,
         to: pattern.object,
         relationType: pattern.verb
       }));
       
       relations.push(...newRelations);
     }
     
     return relations;
   }
   ```

3. **Knowledge Persistence**:
   ```javascript
   // Store thinking results in knowledge graph
   async function persistThinkingToKnowledge(thoughtSequence) {
     // Extract entities and relations
     const entities = extractEntitiesFromThinking(thoughtSequence);
     const relations = extractRelationsFromThinking(thoughtSequence);
     
     // Create thinking session entity
     const sessionId = `thinking_session_${Date.now()}`;
     await createEntities([{
       name: sessionId,
       entityType: "ThinkingSession",
       observations: [
         `Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
         `Thoughts: ${thoughtSequence.length}`,
         `Topic: ${extractTopic(thoughtSequence)}`
       ]
     }]);
     
     // Create thought entities
     const thoughtEntities = thoughtSequence.map((thought, index) => ({
       name: `${sessionId}_thought_${index + 1}`,
       entityType: "Thought",
       observations: [
         thought.thought,
         `Thought number: ${thought.thoughtNumber}`,
         `Created: ${thought.timestamp || new Date().toISOString()}`
       ]
     }));
     
     // Create thought sequence relations
     const thoughtRelations = thoughtSequence.slice(0, -1).map((_, index) => ({
       from: `${sessionId}_thought_${index + 1}`,
       to: `${sessionId}_thought_${index + 2}`,
       relationType: "precedesThought"
     }));
     
     // Create session membership relations
     const sessionRelations = thoughtEntities.map(thought => ({
       from: thought.name,
       to: sessionId,
       relationType: "belongsToSession"
     }));
     
     // Create entities and relations in knowledge graph
     await createEntities(entities);
     await createEntities(thoughtEntities);
     await createRelations(relations);
     await createRelations(thoughtRelations);
     await createRelations(sessionRelations);
     
     return {
       sessionId,
       entityCount: entities.length,
       thoughtCount: thoughtEntities.length,
       relationCount: relations.length + thoughtRelations.length + sessionRelations.length
     };
   }
   ```

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Example workflow
async function analyzeAndPersist(problem) {
  // Perform sequential thinking
  const thoughts = [];
  let currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
    thought: `Initial analysis of ${problem}`,
    thoughtNumber: 1,
    totalThoughts: 5,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  });
  
  thoughts.push(currentThinking);
  
  // Continue thinking
  while (currentThinking.nextThoughtNeeded) {
    currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
      thought: `Continuing analysis of ${problem}`,
      thoughtNumber: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1,
      totalThoughts: currentThinking.totalThoughts,
      nextThoughtNeeded: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1 < currentThinking.totalThoughts
    });
    
    thoughts.push(currentThinking);
  }
  
  // Persist thinking results to knowledge graph
  const result = await persistThinkingToKnowledge(thoughts);
  
  return {
    finalThought: thoughts[thoughts.length - 1].thought,
    persistenceResult: result
  };
}
```

### 3. Iterative Knowledge Refinement

This pattern uses sequential thinking to refine and improve knowledge graph content.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Knowledge Auditing**:
   ```javascript
   // Audit knowledge for consistency and completeness
   async function auditKnowledgeWithThinking(topic) {
     // Retrieve relevant entities
     const relevantEntities = await searchNodes(topic);
     
     // Extract observations for analysis
     const observations = relevantEntities.flatMap(
       entity => entity.observations.map(obs => `[${entity.name}] ${obs}`)
     );
     
     // Use sequential thinking to audit observations
     const auditThinking = await sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Auditing knowledge about ${topic}.\n\nExisting observations:\n${observations.join('\n')}\n\nConsistency analysis:`,
       thoughtNumber: 1,
       totalThoughts: 3,
       nextThoughtNeeded: true
     });
     
     // Continue with gap analysis
     const gapThinking = await sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Identifying knowledge gaps about ${topic} based on existing observations:\n${observations.join('\n')}\n\nGap analysis:`,
       thoughtNumber: 2,
       totalThoughts: 3,
       nextThoughtNeeded: true
     });
     
     // Finish with improvement recommendations
     const recommendationThinking = await sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Recommending improvements to knowledge about ${topic} based on consistency and gap analysis`,
       thoughtNumber: 3,
       totalThoughts: 3,
       nextThoughtNeeded: false
     });
     
     return {
       consistencyAnalysis: auditThinking.thought,
       gapAnalysis: gapThinking.thought,
       recommendations: recommendationThinking.thought
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Knowledge Refinement**:
   ```javascript
   // Refine knowledge based on thinking analysis
   async function refineKnowledgeBasedOnThinking(topic, auditResults) {
     // Use sequential thinking to generate new observations
     const newObservationsThinking = await sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Generating new observations about ${topic} based on audit:\n\n${auditResults.gapAnalysis}\n\nNew observations:`,
       thoughtNumber: 1,
       totalThoughts: 2,
       nextThoughtNeeded: true
     });
     
     // Extract specific observation statements
     const observationStatements = extractObservationStatements(newObservationsThinking.thought);
     
     // Determine which entity to add observations to
     const relevantEntities = await searchNodes(topic);
     
     if (relevantEntities.length === 0) {
       // Create new entity if none exists
       await createEntities([{
         name: formatEntityName(topic),
         entityType: "Concept",
         observations: [
           `Created through knowledge refinement process`,
           `Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
           ...observationStatements
         ]
       }]);
     } else {
       // Add observations to existing entities
       const entityObservations = observationStatements.map(obs => ({
         entityName: relevantEntities[0].name,
         contents: [obs]
       }));
       
       await addObservations({ observations: entityObservations });
     }
     
     // Use sequential thinking to identify relationship refinements
     const relationshipThinking = await sequentialThinking({
       thought: `Identifying relationships involving ${topic} based on audit:\n\n${auditResults.recommendations}\n\nRelationship analysis:`,
       thoughtNumber: 2,
       totalThoughts: 2,
       nextThoughtNeeded: false
     });
     
     // Extract relationship statements
     const relationshipStatements = extractRelationshipStatements(relationshipThinking.thought);
     
     // Create relations
     if (relationshipStatements.length > 0) {
       const relations = relationshipStatements.map(statement => ({
         from: statement.subject,
         to: statement.object,
         relationType: statement.predicate
       }));
       
       await createRelations({ relations });
     }
     
     return {
       newObservations: observationStatements.length,
       newRelations: relationshipStatements.length
     };
   }
   ```

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Example workflow
async function auditAndRefineKnowledge(topic) {
  // Perform knowledge audit
  const auditResults = await auditKnowledgeWithThinking(topic);
  
  // Refine knowledge based on audit
  const refinementResults = await refineKnowledgeBasedOnThinking(topic, auditResults);
  
  return {
    audit: auditResults,
    refinement: refinementResults
  };
}
```

### 4. Reasoning Path Persistence

This pattern preserves complete reasoning paths in the knowledge graph for future reference.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Capture Reasoning Chain**:
   ```javascript
   // Capture full reasoning chain in knowledge graph
   async function persistReasoningChain(thoughtSequence, topic) {
     // Create reasoning chain entity
     const chainId = `reasoning_chain_${Date.now()}`;
     await createEntities([{
       name: chainId,
       entityType: "ReasoningChain",
       observations: [
         `Topic: ${topic}`,
         `Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
         `Steps: ${thoughtSequence.length}`,
         `Conclusion: ${extractConclusion(thoughtSequence)}`
       ]
     }]);
     
     // Create individual reasoning step entities
     const stepEntities = thoughtSequence.map((thought, index) => ({
       name: `${chainId}_step_${index + 1}`,
       entityType: "ReasoningStep",
       observations: [
         thought.thought,
         `Step number: ${index + 1}`,
         `Created: ${thought.timestamp || new Date().toISOString()}`
       ]
     }));
     
     await createEntities(stepEntities);
     
     // Create step sequence relations
     const stepRelations = stepEntities.slice(0, -1).map((step, index) => ({
       from: step.name,
       to: stepEntities[index + 1].name,
       relationType: "leadsTo"
     }));
     
     // Create chain membership relations
     const chainRelations = stepEntities.map(step => ({
       from: step.name,
       to: chainId,
       relationType: "partOf"
     }));
     
     await createRelations([...stepRelations, ...chainRelations]);
     
     // Create relation between chain and topic
     const topicEntity = await findOrCreateTopic(topic);
     await createRelations([{
       from: chainId,
       to: topicEntity.name,
       relationType: "reasonsAbout"
     }]);
     
     return chainId;
   }
   ```

2. **Reasoning Chain Retrieval and Reuse**:
   ```javascript
   // Retrieve and apply existing reasoning chains
   async function retrieveRelevantReasoning(topic) {
     // Find reasoning chains about topic
     const topicEntity = await searchNodes(topic);
     if (topicEntity.length === 0) return null;
     
     // Find chains reasoning about this topic
     const chainsQuery = await searchNodes(`reasonsAbout ${topic}`);
     if (chainsQuery.length === 0) return null;
     
     // Get most relevant chain
     const relevantChain = chainsQuery[0];
     
     // Get chain steps in order
     const graph = await readGraph();
     const steps = graph.entities
       .filter(entity => 
         graph.relations.some(rel => 
           rel.from === entity.name && 
           rel.to === relevantChain.name && 
           rel.relationType === "partOf"
         )
       )
       .sort((a, b) => {
         const aNum = parseInt(a.name.split('_').pop());
         const bNum = parseInt(b.name.split('_').pop());
         return aNum - bNum;
       });
     
     return {
       chainName: relevantChain.name,
       topic,
       steps: steps.map(step => {
         const stepContent = step.observations.find(obs => !obs.startsWith('Step number:') && !obs.startsWith('Created:'));
         return stepContent || '';
       })
     };
   }
   ```

#### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Example workflow
async function reasonWithHistory(topic) {
  // Check for existing reasoning
  const existingReasoning = await retrieveRelevantReasoning(topic);
  
  // Use existing reasoning or create new
  if (existingReasoning) {
    // Continue from existing reasoning
    console.log(`Found existing reasoning about ${topic}`);
    console.log(`Chain: ${existingReasoning.chainName}`);
    console.log(`Steps: ${existingReasoning.steps.length}`);
    
    // Generate new thinking that builds on previous reasoning
    const thoughts = [];
    let currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
      thought: `Continuing reasoning about ${topic} based on previous analysis:\n\n${existingReasoning.steps.join('\n\n')}\n\nAdditional insights:`,
      thoughtNumber: 1,
      totalThoughts: 3,
      nextThoughtNeeded: true
    });
    
    thoughts.push(currentThinking);
    
    // Continue thinking
    while (currentThinking.nextThoughtNeeded) {
      currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
        thought: `Further developing analysis of ${topic}`,
        thoughtNumber: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1,
        totalThoughts: currentThinking.totalThoughts,
        nextThoughtNeeded: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1 < currentThinking.totalThoughts
      });
      
      thoughts.push(currentThinking);
    }
    
    // Persist new reasoning chain that builds on previous
    const newChainId = await persistReasoningChain(thoughts, topic);
    
    // Link new chain to previous
    await createRelations([{
      from: newChainId,
      to: existingReasoning.chainName,
      relationType: "extendsReasoning"
    }]);
    
    return {
      chainId: newChainId,
      extendedChain: existingReasoning.chainName,
      thoughts
    };
  } else {
    // Create new reasoning from scratch
    console.log(`No existing reasoning about ${topic}, creating new`);
    
    // Generate new thinking
    const thoughts = [];
    let currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
      thought: `Initial analysis of ${topic}`,
      thoughtNumber: 1,
      totalThoughts: 5,
      nextThoughtNeeded: true
    });
    
    thoughts.push(currentThinking);
    
    // Continue thinking
    while (currentThinking.nextThoughtNeeded) {
      currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
        thought: `Continuing analysis of ${topic}`,
        thoughtNumber: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1,
        totalThoughts: currentThinking.totalThoughts,
        nextThoughtNeeded: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1 < currentThinking.totalThoughts
      });
      
      thoughts.push(currentThinking);
    }
    
    // Persist reasoning chain
    const chainId = await persistReasoningChain(thoughts, topic);
    
    return {
      chainId,
      thoughts
    };
  }
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Knowledge-Driven Analysis

```javascript
// Example: Analyze problem with knowledge support
async function analyzeWithKnowledgeSupport(problem) {
  // Step 1: Search knowledge graph for relevant context
  const relevantKnowledge = await searchNodes(problem);
  console.log(`Found ${relevantKnowledge.length} relevant knowledge nodes`);
  
  // Step 2: Extract observations from relevant knowledge
  const observations = relevantKnowledge.flatMap(
    node => node.observations.map(obs => `[${node.name}] ${obs}`)
  );
  
  // Step 3: Begin sequential thinking with context
  const thoughts = [];
  let currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
    thought: `Analyzing problem: ${problem}\n\nRelevant knowledge:\n${observations.join('\n')}\n\nInitial analysis:`,
    thoughtNumber: 1,
    totalThoughts: 5, 
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  });
  
  thoughts.push(currentThinking);
  
  // Step 4: Continue thinking with progressive knowledge enrichment
  while (currentThinking.nextThoughtNeeded) {
    // Extract key concepts from current thought
    const concepts = extractKeyTerms(currentThinking.thought);
    
    // Get additional knowledge about these concepts
    const additionalKnowledge = await Promise.all(
      concepts.map(concept => searchNodes(concept))
    );
    
    const newObservations = additionalKnowledge
      .flat()
      .flatMap(node => node.observations.map(obs => `[${node.name}] ${obs}`))
      .filter(obs => !observations.includes(obs)); // Only new observations
    
    // Continue thinking with enriched knowledge
    currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
      thought: `Continuing analysis with additional knowledge:\n\n${newObservations.length > 0 ? newObservations.join('\n') + '\n\n' : ''}Based on current understanding, I can reason that:`,
      thoughtNumber: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1,
      totalThoughts: currentThinking.totalThoughts,
      nextThoughtNeeded: currentThinking.thoughtNumber + 1 < currentThinking.totalThoughts
    });
    
    thoughts.push(currentThinking);
  }
  
  // Step 5: Persist key insights to knowledge graph
  const newEntities = extractEntities(thoughts);
  if (newEntities.length > 0) {
    await createEntities(newEntities);
  }
  
  const newRelations = extractRelations(thoughts);
  if (newRelations.length > 0) {
    await createRelations(newRelations);
  }
  
  // Step 6: Return final analysis
  return {
    analysis: thoughts[thoughts.length - 1].thought,
    thoughtChain: thoughts,
    newKnowledge: {
      entities: newEntities.length,
      relations: newRelations.length
    }
  };
}
```

### Comparative Analysis with Knowledge Support

```javascript
// Example: Compare options with knowledge support
async function compareOptionsWithKnowledge(options, criteria) {
  // Step 1: Build knowledge context for each option
  const optionKnowledge = await Promise.all(
    options.map(async option => {
      const nodes = await searchNodes(option);
      return {
        option,
        knowledge: nodes.flatMap(node => node.observations)
      };
    })
  );
  
  // Step 2: Build knowledge context for criteria
  const criteriaKnowledge = await Promise.all(
    criteria.map(async criterion => {
      const nodes = await searchNodes(criterion);
      return {
        criterion,
        knowledge: nodes.flatMap(node => node.observations)
      };
    })
  );
  
  // Step 3: Setup comparison matrix
  const comparisonSetup = `
    Comparing options: ${options.join(', ')}
    Using criteria: ${criteria.join(', ')}
    
    Knowledge about options:
    ${optionKnowledge.map(ok => 
      `${ok.option}:\n${ok.knowledge.map(k => `- ${k}`).join('\n')}`
    ).join('\n\n')}
    
    Knowledge about criteria:
    ${criteriaKnowledge.map(ck => 
      `${ck.criterion}:\n${ck.knowledge.map(k => `- ${k}`).join('\n')}`
    ).join('\n\n')}
  `;
  
  // Step 4: Use sequential thinking for comparison
  const thoughts = [];
  
  // Initial setup thinking
  let currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
    thought: `Setting up comparison of options ${options.join(', ')} using criteria ${criteria.join(', ')}. Will evaluate each option against each criterion based on available knowledge.`,
    thoughtNumber: 1,
    totalThoughts: criteria.length + 2,
    nextThoughtNeeded: true
  });
  
  thoughts.push(currentThinking);
  
  // Evaluate each criterion
  for (let i = 0; i < criteria.length; i++) {
    const criterion = criteria[i];
    
    currentThinking = await sequentialThinking({
      thought: `Evaluating options against criterion: ${criterion}\n\n${options.map(option => `${option}:`).join('\n')}`,
      thoughtNumber: i + 2,
      totalThoughts: criteria.length + 2,

## Best Practices

### 1. Clean Knowledge Boundaries

Maintain clear boundaries between thinking processes and knowledge:

- **Thinking is Ephemeral**: Use sequential thinking for active, in-the-moment reasoning
- **Knowledge is Persistent**: Store only validated, reusable insights in the knowledge graph
- **Explicit Transitions**: Clearly mark when thinking results are being converted to knowledge

### 2. Contextual Enrichment

Use knowledge effectively to enrich thinking:

- **Selective Retrieval**: Only retrieve knowledge relevant to current thinking step
- **Progressive Enrichment**: Add knowledge gradually as thinking progresses
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain reference to knowledge sources in thinking

### 3. Knowledge Validation

Validate thinking results before preservation:

- **Confidence Assessment**: Only store high-confidence insights
- **Consistency Checking**: Verify new insights don't contradict existing knowledge
- **Source Attribution**: Track the reasoning process that generated knowledge

### 4. Temporal Integration

Integrate temporal tracking in the combined system:

- **Thought Timestamps**: Record when each thinking step occurred
- **Knowledge Evolution**: Track how thinking changes knowledge over time
- **Reasoning Versioning**: Maintain versions of reasoning chains as they evolve

### 5. Reasoning Reuse

Design for reusability of reasoning:

- **Abstraction**: Extract generalizable reasoning patterns from specific instances
- **Template Creation**: Convert successful reasoning chains into reusable templates
- **Adaptation**: Modify existing reasoning chains for new but similar problems

## Potential Pitfalls

1. **Knowledge Overload**: Retrieving too much knowledge can overwhelm thinking process
   - *Solution*: Implement relevance filtering and progressive disclosure

2. **Circular Reasoning**: New thinking references knowledge that came from similar thinking
   - *Solution*: Track provenance of knowledge and avoid self-reference loops

3. **Premature Persistence**: Storing speculative or low-confidence thoughts as knowledge
   - *Solution*: Implement confidence thresholds for knowledge persistence

4. **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Creating too many disconnected entities from thinking
   - *Solution*: Focus on integrating new insights with existing knowledge structure

5. **Retrieval Inefficiency**: Poor performance when searching large knowledge bases
   - *Solution*: Implement knowledge indexing and caching for frequent reasoning patterns

## Advanced Techniques

### Reasoning Templates

Create reusable reasoning templates for common patterns:

```javascript
// Create reasoning template from successful thinking
async function createReasoningTemplate(thoughtSequence, templateName, parameters) {
  // Extract the abstract structure of the reasoning
  const abstractSteps = thoughtSequence.map(thought => {
    let abstractThought = thought.thought;
    
    // Replace specific terms with parameter placeholders
    for (const [param, value] of Object.entries(parameters)) {
      const regex = new RegExp(escapeRegExp(value), 'g');
      abstractThought = abstractThought.replace(regex, `{{${param}}}`);
    }
    
    return abstractThought;
  });
  
  // Create template entity
  await createEntities([{
    name: `template_${templateName}`,
    entityType: "ReasoningTemplate",
    observations: [
      `Template for: ${templateName}`,
      `Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
      `Parameters: ${Object.keys(parameters).join(', ')}`,
      `Steps: ${abstractSteps.length}`
    ]
  }]);
  
  // Create step entities
  const stepEntities = abstractSteps.map((step, index) => ({
    name: `template_${templateName}_step_${index + 1}`,
    entityType: "TemplateStep",
    observations: [
      step,
      `Step number: ${index + 1}`
    ]
  }));
  
  await createEntities(stepEntities);
  
  // Create template structure relations
  const stepRelations = stepEntities.slice(0, -1).map((step, index) => ({
    from: step.name,
    to: stepEntities[index + 1].name,
    relationType: "nextStep"
  }));
  
  const templateRelations = stepEntities.map(step => ({
    from: step.name,
    to: `template_${templateName}`,
    relationType: "partOf"
  }));
  
  await createRelations([...stepRelations, ...templateRelations]);
  
  return `template_${templateName}`;
}

// Apply reasoning template to new problem
async function applyReasoningTemplate(templateName, parameters) {
  // Retrieve template
  const template = await searchNodes(`template_${templateName}`);
  if (template.length === 0) {
    throw new Error(`Template ${templateName} not found`);
  }
  
  // Get template steps
  const graph = await readGraph();
  const steps = graph.entities
    .filter(entity => 
      graph.relations.some(rel => 
        rel.from === entity.name && 
        rel.to === `template_${templateName}` && 
        rel.relationType === "partOf"
      )
    )
    .sort((a, b) => {
      const aNum = parseInt(a.name.split('_').pop());
      const bNum = parseInt(b.name.split('_').pop());
      return aNum - bNum;
    });
  
  // Extract step content
  const stepContents = steps.map(step => {
    const content = step.observations.find(obs => !obs.startsWith('Step number:'));
    return content || '';
  });
  
  // Apply parameters to template
  const instantiatedSteps = stepContents.map(step => {
    let instantiated = step;
    
    for (const [param, value] of Object.entries(parameters)) {
      const placeholder = new RegExp(`{{${param}}}`, 'g');
      instantiated = instantiated.replace(placeholder, value);
    }
    
    return instantiated;
  });
  
  // Execute reasoning using template
  const thoughts = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < instantiatedSteps.length; i++) {
    const isLast = i === instantiatedSteps.length - 1;
    
    const thinking = await sequentialThinking({
      thought: instantiatedSteps[i],
      thoughtNumber: i + 1,
      totalThoughts: instantiatedSteps.length,
      nextThoughtNeeded: !isLast
    });
    
    thoughts.push(thinking);
  }
  
  return {
    templateName,
    parameters,
    thoughts
  };
}
```

### Reasoning with Uncertainty

Incorporate uncertainty handling in the integrated system:

```javascript
// Reasoning with uncertainty tracking
async function reasonWithUncertainty(topic, initialBeliefs) {
  // Initialize belief states in knowledge graph
  const beliefStates = initialBeliefs.map(belief => ({
    statement: belief.statement,
    confidence: belief.confidence,
    evidence: belief.evidence || []
  }));
  
  // Store initial beliefs
  await createEntities([{
    name: `belief_set_${topic.replace(/\s+/g, '_')}`,
    entityType: "BeliefSet",
    observations: [
      `Topic: ${topic}`,
      `Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
      `Initial beliefs: ${beliefStates.length}`
    ]
  }]);
  
  // Store individual beliefs
  for (const belief of beliefStates) {
    await createEntities([{
      name: `belief_${hashString(belief.statement)}`,
      entityType: "Belief",
      observations: [
        `Statement: ${belief.statement}`,

        ...belief.evidence.map(e => `Evidence: ${e}`)
      ]
    }]);
    
    // Link to belief set
    await createRelations([{
      from: `belief_${hashString(belief.statement)}`,

      // Update existing belief
      await addObservations({
        observations: [{
          entityName: beliefName,
          contents: [
            `Updated confidence: ${belief.confidence}`,
            `Updated: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
            ...belief.evidence.map(e => `New evidence: ${e}`)
          ]
        }]
      });
    } else {
      // Create new belief
      await createEntities([{
        name: beliefName,
        entityType: "Belief",
        observations: [
          `Statement: ${belief.statement}`,
          `Confidence: ${belief.confidence}`,
          `Created: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
          ...belief.evidence.map(e => `Evidence: ${e}`)
        ]
      }]);
      
      // Link to belief set
      await createRelations([{
        from: beliefName,
