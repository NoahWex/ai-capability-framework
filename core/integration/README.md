# Capability Integration Framework

This directory contains patterns and techniques for effectively combining multiple capabilities.

## Integration Patterns

Key integration patterns include:

- Sequential workflows that chain capabilities in effective sequences
- Parallel processing for multi-faceted analysis
- Feedback loops that allow iterative refinement
- Cross-capability data sharing protocols
- Workflow orchestration for complex scenarios

These patterns enable more sophisticated assistance than any single capability could provide.
